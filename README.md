# Python Playground

Welcome to Python Playground! This repository contains various Python files that I've created during my learning journey. I use this repo to document my learning progress and share it with anyone interested.

## File List

Here's a list of files in this repo along with a brief description:

1. [**gdk2krsv3.py**](gdk2krsv3.py): This is a python script that can transform geodetic coordinates to cartesian.

## How to Run

If you want to run or try out the files in this repo, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. If not, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

2. Clone this repo to your computer using the command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/username/python-playground.git
    ```

3. Open a terminal or command prompt, then navigate to the directory where you've cloned this repo.

4. To run Python files, simply execute the command:

    ```
    python file_name.py
    ```

    Replace `file_name.py` with the name of the file you want to run.

5. To run Jupyter notebooks, you need to install Jupyter Notebook first. Then, execute the command:

    ```
    jupyter notebook data_analysis.ipynb
    ```

    Make sure you are in the directory where the notebook is located.
